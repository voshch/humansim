# core

The simulator's central subsystems live here: the agent pool, the tick-scheduling `AgentManager`, behavior-tree compilation, interaction routing, and shared access/formation primitives. Most of the state that survives across ticks is owned by something in this directory.

This README focuses on **`InteractionManager`** - the only piece of core with non-obvious behavior that isn't already covered by a sibling readme. See also:

- [behavior/README.md](behavior/README.md) - behavior-tree node invariants (`SeekNode`, patience, cancel).

## InteractionManager

Router over `NAVIGATE` / `STOP` / `SEEK` commands. `NAVIGATE` is ignored here (consumed upstream by the locomotion layer); `STOP` drops an agent from one interaction or force-stops across all; `SEEK` is the only matcher entry point.

## `_handle_seek` flow

Each `SEEK` carries a `SeekSpec`. Dispatch consults `spec.interaction_type.kind.handle.strategy` (from the per-type registry in [interaction_kinds.py](interaction_kinds.py)):

1. **Already a member?** Iterate `_agent_membership[agent_id]`; if any existing interaction passes `strategy.matches(interaction, spec)`, return - no duplicate membership.
2. **Find existing.** Only seekers (`spec.offer=False`) enter this branch - providers always create, never join another provider's offer. `strategy.find(self, spec, agent_id)` returns an admissible interaction id or `None`. On hit, `accept(agent_id, iid)` joins (as `PARTICIPANT` or, if the access policy queues, `QUEUED`) and stamps `spec.duration` into `member_durations`.
3. **Create.** If `strategy.can_create(self, spec, agent_id)` passes, `_create_interaction(creator_id=agent_id, spec=spec)` runs. `OBJECT` handles first resolve `spec.target` through `WorldKnowledge.resolve` so the created interaction keys on a concrete `object_id`.

Within a single `update(dt)` call, commands are sorted so `spec.offer=True` dispatches before seekers. This guarantees a same-tick seeker can match a provider's freshly-created interaction instead of racing past it.

## Handle kinds

Four `HandleKind`s, one strategy each, all in `interaction_kinds.py`:

| Kind | Target shape | `find` scan | `populate_state` writes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NONE` (symmetric: TALK_TO, GROUP_CONVERSATION, WAVE_AT) | omitted | `_scan_symmetric` - visible peer of same type | - |
| `TAG` (SERVICE) | `str` tag | `_scan_tag` - visible provider with matching `service_tag`; requires `offer=True` to create | `state["service_tag"]` |
| `AGENT` (BLOCK) | `int` agent id | `_scan_agent` - interaction with matching `target_agent` | `state["target_agent"]` |
| `OBJECT` (SIT_ON, LIE_ON, USE, QUEUE_USE) | `str` object or type | `_find_object_bound` - `_interaction_by_object_type[(object_id, type)]`, then retry via `WorldKnowledge.resolve` | returns `object_id` (stored on `InteractionState.object_id`, not `state[]`) |

`SERVICE` offers additionally set `state["provider"] = creator_id` when `spec.offer` is true.

## Hot-path indexes

Maintained in `_add_membership` / `_drop_membership` / `_create_interaction` / `_teardown`:

- `_interactions_by_type: dict[int, set[int]]` - all live interaction ids keyed by `int(InteractionType)`; every `_scan_*` iterates one bucket.
- `_interaction_by_object_type: dict[tuple[str, int], int]` - the single active interaction for an `(object_id, type)` pair. Cleared on teardown so a new seeker can create a fresh one.
- `_agent_membership: dict[int, dict[int, MembershipRole]]` - per-agent map of interaction id -> `PARTICIPANT | QUEUED`. Replaces the older `_agent_to_interactions` / `_agent_to_queues` split; `_iter_membership(aid, role=...)` filters.

## Contract duration

`_tick_durations(dt)` advances `contract.elapsed` only while the interaction is `ACTIVE` and - when a formation is attached - every participant satisfies `formation.arrived(pid)`. On expiry:

- With a queued `access` policy and a non-empty queue, current participants are released via `_release_participant`, the policy promotes the next batch, and `contract.elapsed` resets - letting `duration` stretch across successive holders without tearing the interaction down. A per-member override in `member_durations` becomes the next `contract.duration`.
- Otherwise, `_teardown(iid, InteractionOutcome.COMPLETED)` fires.

`_teardown(outcome)` clears indexes, drops memberships, leaves formations, and propagates outcome (`COMPLETED` / `CANCELED` / `INTERRUPTED`) to every ex-member's BT movement.

## Drift eviction

`_tick_drift_eviction` runs every `update(dt)` immediately before `_tick_formations`. For each `ACTIVE` interaction it computes a per-participant proximity check and `stop(aid, iid, INTERRUPTED)`s any participant past the threshold:

- **Object-bound** (`kind.is_object_bound`): distance from the participant to `WorldKnowledge.object_pose(interaction.object_id)`.
- **Otherwise** (`NONE` / `TAG` / `AGENT`): distance from the participant to its nearest other participant. Skipped while the interaction has fewer than two locatable participants.

Threshold is `kind.interaction_radius * cohesion_multiplier` (`InteractionManager.__init__`, default 1.2). Same radius as request-time proximity, scaled up slightly for engagement-bubble slack - an evicted agent is past the seek-match boundary by construction, so a re-seek on the next BT tick can't immediately rejoin without first walking back into range.

A per-participant latch (`interaction.state["_drift_arrived"]`) gates eviction: a participant is only evictable after first being observed within the threshold. "Drift" applies to participants who arrived and then left, not to ones still inbound - without this latch, a freshly-`ACTIVE` interaction whose formation hasn't pulled members in yet would self-evict on tick 1.

Eviction surgically drops the offender from one interaction; if the participant count falls below `min_participants`, `stop()` cascades into `_teardown(INTERRUPTED)` as usual.

## BT state propagation

All BT side-effects funnel through one helper:

```python
_update_bt_movement(aid, *, interaction_id=..., clear_command=..., last_outcome=...)
```

Each keyword is optional (sentinel `_UNSET`). It no-ops unless a field actually changed, and it only touches agents whose movement is a `BehaviorTreeMovement`. `BehaviorTreeMovement` carries `{command, last_outcome, interaction_id}`; `SeekNode` reads `interaction_id` to know it's bound, `last_outcome` to know how the previous step ended. `_tick_formations` writes a fresh `NAVIGATE` command each tick for every arrived-but-moving participant.

## Formation resolution

`_resolve_formation(interaction)` picks the first of:

1. Step-level `spec.formation_spec` (authored on the `SeekSpec` / scenario step).
2. Object-level metadata - `WorldObject.formation` for `interaction.object_id`.
3. Registry default - `InteractionType(...).kind.formation_default`.

`_anchor_from_spec(spec, interaction)` dispatches on `AnchorKind`:

- `OBJECT` -> `ObjectAnchor` on `spec.anchor_ref or interaction.object_id`.
- `AGENT` -> `AgentAnchor` on `int(spec.anchor_ref)`.
- `PROVIDER` -> `AgentAnchor` on `interaction.provider` (used by SERVICE's `f_formation`).
- `POSE` -> `PoseAnchor` on `spec.anchor_pose`.
- `CENTROID` -> `CentroidAnchor` over live participants.

Unresolvable anchors return `None` and the interaction runs without a formation.

## What lives elsewhere

- **Proximity gating.** The compiler emits `ResolveObjectNode -> GoToNode -> SeekNode` for object-bound interaction steps; `GoToNode` only returns SUCCESS within `interaction_radius`, so `SEEK` never fires before arrival.
- **Per-type defaults.** `contract_defaults`, `formation_default`, and `interaction_radius` all live on `InteractionKind` in [interaction_kinds.py](interaction_kinds.py). See [config/scenarios/README.md](../../config/scenarios/README.md) for the authoring cascade.
